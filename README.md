# NASA SpaceApps Hackathon

## Introduction

Our team (AgriCarer) is seeking to tackle the knowledge inequality problem currently faced by many farmers from developing countries. From our research and personal conversations with a local farmer in Malaysia, we found that most farmers in developing countries are smallholders farmers that generally lack access to best agriculture practices, data and information. Smallholders farmers do not have funding/investments necessary to procure state-of-the-art technologies and seek expert advice. Thus, local farmers are very vulnerable to the occurences of diseases and pest in ruining their entire crop and reducing their crop productivity. In some cases, the whole farm may have no yield as no proper actions are taken due to the lack of knowledge. This can lead to problems such as food security and environmental issues.

We are proposing an user friendly smartphone app to support farmers with state-of-the-art technologies and expert research advice. A smartphone app will lower down the cost of entry for farmers as most farmers already owns a smartphone. The smartphone app proposed will have features such as remote sensing technology, plant disease diagnosis,  and reminders. 



## Remote Sensing Technology 

The remote sensing technology will done by collecting free open-source satellite data from space agencies around the world such as NASA and ESA.

## Plant Disease Diagnosis

This repository consist of a simple prototype/proof of an AI system is able to classify different plant diseases. We used the FastAI API to train on our dataset. The dataset was obtained from PlantVillage, PlantVillage
